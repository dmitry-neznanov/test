BABYMONSTER

I got no worries on my mind
nan meomchuji ana
So you can say goodbye
I’ll fulfill my fantasy
And you can watch and see
baksuna chyeoboji

nunbushyeo
They say she looking flawless
I know
tagonatji Like this
She’s unlike unlike anybody
yeogijeogi da nalli nalli
ganadaramaba ssagaji
Gotta gotta go so c’est la vie

I’m dancing in the moonlight
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
